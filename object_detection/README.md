# Training Yolo License Plate Recoginizer

In this notebook, I use YOLOv4 with Darknet framework to train custom object detection.

## Getting Started

We use dataset from [Open Image Dataset V4](Dataset) and looking for Vehicle Plate Number class. If you want to try to train this dataset, you can use 1500 training images and 300 test images ratio to make your model better.

Or you can use my dataset here: [download][Google Drive]

Also you need to download [Darknet Framework][DarkNet] to train data.

## Training

Please follow all the instruction in ipynb file. I try to explain in there clearly.
