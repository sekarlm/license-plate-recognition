# Getting started

Get file from here for [model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R7lvzRBZ6dNMqW-AMiVLlVD6Kz3TRjTU/view?usp=sharing). Make ``checkpoints`` directory in this folder and unzip previous model to ``checkpoints`` directory.

And then run this command to install requirements.

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

After no error detected, run **``python app.py``** and flask server will start automatically.
